# 🐻‍❄️🪚 `azalia::config`
The **azalia_config** Rust crate defines types and utilities dealing with application configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> This crate supports **no-std** environments and **no-alloc** environments with features being disabled if either
> the `std` or `alloc` crate features are excluded. Documentation in [`docs.rs`](https://docs.rs/azalia-config) will
> give you information if a trait, function, or module requires either the **std** or **alloc** features.
