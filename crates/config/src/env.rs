//! Types and functions that interact with the system environment variables.

/// Represents a guard that sets an environment variable and removes it as its [`Drop`] impl. This is
/// mainly useful for testing and shouldn't be used in production code.
///
/// ## Safety
/// This is safe to call in a single-threaded environment but might be unstable and unsafe
/// to call when in a multi-threaded situation. As advertised, this is mainly for unit testing
/// and shouldn't be used in other production code, so it is safe to call at any `#[test]` fn.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```
/// # use azalia_config::{expand, env};
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// // `expand` will create a `EnvGuard` that will be dropped
/// // once this goes out of scope
/// expand("ENV", || {
///     // this will print `Ok("1")`
///     println!("{:?}", env!("ENV"));
/// });
/// # }
/// ```

    /// the [`expand`] function instead to set `env` to `1` and be dropped once a closure
    /// is done invoking.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```
    /// # use azalia_config::EnvGuard;
    /// #
    /// # fn main() {
    /// let _guard = EnvGuard::enter("ENV");
    /// // `ENV` will be 1 and once it is dropped, it will be no longer available.
    /// # }
