//! # üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èü™ö `azalia-serde`
//! The **azalia-serde** crate provides blanket `serde` implementations for crates that don't expose any. This
//! uses Cargo's crate features to explicitly enable which implementations you need, rather than adding them all
//! at once.
//!
//! We only provide implementations to Rust types that are most used by us, so we will probably reject most
//! requests to add more types other than the ones listed.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ### `tracing::Level` (requires `tracing` feature)
//! ```
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     #[serde(with = "azalia_serde::tracing")]
//!     level: tracing::Level,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### `aws_types::types::Region` (requires `aws` feature)
//! ```
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     #[serde(with = "azalia_serde::aws::region")]
//!     region: aws_sdk_s3::types::Region
//! }
// ```
