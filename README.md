### üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èü™ö Azalia
#### *Family of crates for Noelware's Rust projects that implement repetitive code*

**Important** ‚Äî As of March 16, 2025: we are publishing all Azalia crates onto [crates.io] so it can be easily accessible to projects that might need it.

**Azalia** is a family of Rust crates that is maintained by **Noelware, LLC.** to implement common functionality that is otherwise copied and can be into a open source library instead. While you can cherry-pick which Azalia crates you might need, it's far easier to use the [`azalia`] centralised crate that can toggle other Azalia crates via Cargo's crate features feature.
